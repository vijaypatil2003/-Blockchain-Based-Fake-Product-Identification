# Literature Survey :

The problem of counterfeit products in the supply chain has drawn considerable attention in
recent years, and several researchers have proposed the integration of blockchain technology as
an effective solution. This section summarizes key contributions from the existing literature
related to blockchain-based fake product identification systems.
Ajay Funde et al. (2022) proposed a blockchain-based framework to identify counterfeit products in the supply chain. Their system records product details using smart contracts and verifies
authenticity through decentralized access, reducing the reliance on third parties and increasing
transparency.[1]
Y. Dabbagh et al. (2022) developed a comprehensive fake product identification system utilizing blockchain and IoT integration. Their work focuses on real-time tracking and verification,
highlighting the importance of sensor data and immutable ledgers to build trust among stakeholders.[2]
M. C. Jayaprasanna et al. (2021) presented a blockchain-based product management system
that traces product origins and transactions. Their model emphasizes product lifecycle tracking
and helps manufacturers ensure product legitimacy at every distribution stage.[3]
Shivam Singh et al. (2021) introduced a blockchain solution specifically designed for counterfeit
detection in the supply chain. Their system focuses on creating unique transaction records that
can be easily verified by consumers, manufacturers, and regulatory bodies.[4]
Eka Dyar Wahyuni and Arif Djunaidy (2016) addressed the issue of fake reviews influencing
product perception by consumers. Although not blockchain-specific, their method of iterative computation provides insights into trust management within digital marketplaces, which
complements the idea of secure, verifiable product data.[5]
N. Agrawal et al. (2022) proposed a blockchain-based detection system capable of flagging counterfeit products during supply chain transitions. Their work combines smart contracts
with QR code scanning, ensuring authenticity validation at the point of sale.[6]
Shastri C. Srikrishna (2022) demonstrated a blockchain framework that supports decentralized
verification of product authenticity. Their research highlights how product ownership history
and digital signatures enhance traceability and prevent tampering.[7]
Overall, the reviewed literature confirms that blockchain technology, when integrated with
IoT, QR codes, and smart contracts, presents a robust solution for detecting and preventing
counterfeit products. The systems proposed in these studies provide real-time transparency,
ensure secure transactions, and empower consumers with verification tools.



# Review of Existing System(s):

Several systems have been proposed and developed to address the issue of counterfeit products,
leveraging various technologies such as machine learning, blockchain, and traditional verification
methods. Below is an overview of some of the existing systems that aim to detect and prevent
counterfeit products in the supply chain:

Fake Review Detection System:
Eka Dyar Wahyuni and Arif Djunaidy, in their 2016 paper [?], propose a method to detect
fake reviews in online product reviews. This system uses an iterative computation method to
identify fraudulent reviews that may mislead consumers into purchasing counterfeit products.
By analyzing the patterns of product reviews, the system aims to distinguish between authentic
and fake reviews, thereby providing consumers with reliable feedback about products before
making purchasing decisions.

Blockchain-Based Management System for Counterfeit Detection:
In 2021, M. C. Jayaprasanna and others [?] presented a blockchain-based management system
designed to detect counterfeit products in the supply chain. The system utilizes blockchainâ€™s
decentralized and immutable nature to ensure transparency and traceability of products. By
recording every transaction from the manufacturing stage to the point of sale, the system
enables consumers and manufacturers to track the authenticity of products and identify any
counterfeit goods in the supply chain. The use of smart contracts further automates the verification process, ensuring a more secure and reliable method of authentication.



# Limitations of Existing System(s):

While there are several systems that aim to tackle the problem of counterfeit products, many
of them have certain limitations that reduce their effectiveness. These limitations can range
from technological constraints to practical challenges in implementation. Below are some of
the key limitations identified in existing systems:

Dependence on Centralized Databases:
    Most existing systems, especially those that rely on databases for tracking products, are often
centralized. A centralized database introduces a single point of failure, which can be vulnerable to hacking, data corruption, and unauthorized changes. Without decentralization, these
systems lack the trust and security features provided by technologies like blockchain.

Lack of User Engagement and Accessibility:
Some systems, especially those relying on complex authentication methods or specialized hardware, fail to engage a broad range of users. In many cases, consumers are either unaware of
these systems or find them difficult to use. The accessibility of the system, whether through
web interfaces or mobile apps, is crucial for ensuring widespread adoption, but many current
systems fall short in terms of user-friendliness.
