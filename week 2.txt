# Problem Statement

Counterfeit products are a major concern in today’s global market. These products are manufactured and sold with the intent to deceive customers into believing they are purchasing
original branded goods. The problem is made worse by the fact that many counterfeit items
are nearly identical in appearance to the real ones, making it very difficult for consumers to
identify them. This leads to serious risks, such as health hazards, financial losses, and damage
to brand reputation. The core issue lies in the lack of a secure and transparent system for verifying product authenticity. Current methods are either too complex, unreliable, or not easily
accessible to the general public. Therefore, there is a need for an effective, user-friendly solution that can help users verify the originality of a product before purchase. Our project aims
to address this issue by creating a blockchain-based system that ensures product authenticity
through secure data recording and QR code scanning.



# Objectives of the Work

The main objective of this project is to develop a reliable and secure system for fake product identification using blockchain technology. The goal is to help customers, retailers, and
manufacturers easily verify the authenticity of a product and reduce the spread of counterfeit
goods.

Here are the detailed objectives:

1. To study the current problems related to fake products: Understand how counterfeit
goods affect customers and businesses, and why existing methods of product verification
are not enough.

2. To explore blockchain technology and its features: Learn how blockchain can be used to
store product data in a way that is secure, transparent, and unchangeable.

3. To design a product tracking system using blockchain: Create a system that can store
the details of each product as it moves from manufacturer to consumer.

4. To integrate QR code scanning for user access: Generate a unique QR code for each
product that users can scan to get the product’s details and check its authenticity.

5. To develop a user-friendly web interface: Build a simple platform where customers,
sellers, and manufacturers can interact with the system to add, verify, or track products.

6. To create awareness about product authenticity: Encourage the use of this system to
help build trust among consumers and reduce the impact of counterfeit goods in the
market.

7. To address the rise in counterfeit goods: This project is motivated by the increasing
prevalence of fake products, which harm consumers and legitimate businesses. Developing
an effective anti-counterfeit system aims to curb this growing problem.

8. To develop a comprehensive anti-counterfeit system: The goal is to create a robust
solution that not only detects fake products but also prevents their circulation by ensuring
product data integrity and traceability throughout the supply chain.

9. To use QR codes as a security measure: By embedding unique QR codes in each product,
the system safeguards product information and enables easy, reliable access to authenticity
data for consumers.
