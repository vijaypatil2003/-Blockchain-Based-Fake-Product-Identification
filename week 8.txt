# IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

1. Add Product Page
The Add Product webpage serves as a crucial interface for manufacturers to enter product
details into the blockchain system. This interface is designed to be intuitive and accessible,
allowing authenticated manufacturers to securely register their products.
The page contains a clearly visible heading titled “Add Product” at the top, which indicates
the purpose of the page. Below this heading, the user is presented with a structured form
consisting of several input fields:
• Manufacturer ID: A unique identifier assigned to the manufacturer, ensuring traceability
and authenticity of the product source.
• Product SN (Serial Number): A unique code representing the product. This will be used
later for verification by customers.
• Product Price: The price of the product entered in numeric format, providing economic
details for tracking.
• Product Name: The name of the product, allowing easy identification.
• Product Brand: The brand or company name under which the product is sold      

2. 8 QR Code Generation
The QR Code Generation feature is a vital component of the Blockchain-Based Fake Product
Identification System. It acts as a secure bridge between a physical product and its digital
identity on the blockchain, enabling consumers to verify product authenticity through a simple
scan.
When a manufacturer submits product details on the Add Product page, the backend
system performs data validation and records the information on the blockchain using smart
contracts. Once the data is successfully registered, the system triggers the QR code generation
module, which creates a unique QR code based on the Product Serial Number (Product SN).
In some cases, additional encrypted metadata may also be embedded in the QR code to improve
traceability and ensure more robust verification


3.  Sell Product to Consumer Page
The Sell Product to Consumer page is a key interface designed for sellers to transfer product ownership to end consumers and ensure traceability within the blockchain network. This
function is vital for maintaining the integrity of the product supply chain and preventing the
circulation of counterfeit goods.
User Interface Overview
The webpage is presented with a clean and user-friendly design. At the top, a bold heading
titled FAKE PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION THROUGH BLOCKCHAIN is displayed, along
with a navigation bar that includes the following tab


4.  Consumer Product History Page
The Consumer Product History page is designed to allow users to retrieve and view the
purchase history of a product using their unique Consumer Code. This feature ensures transparency and provides assurance regarding product authenticity and its ownership trai assigned consumer identification code. This field is followed by a prominent yellow button labeled “Get Product”. When clicked, the system fetches and displays product history associated
with the entered consumer code.
Below the input section, the webpage displays the heading “Product Purchased by Consumer”, followed by a structured table that presents the relevant product information in a clear
and concise format. The table consists of the following columns:
• Product SN: The unique serial number of the product purchased.
• Seller Code: The identification code of the seller from whom the product was purchased.
• Manufacturer Code: The unique identifier of the manufacturer who originally registered
the product.
This page helps build trust by enabling consumers to confirm their product’s legitimacy and
trace its journey through the supply chain, from the manufacturer to the final point of sale.



5. Verify Product Page
The Verify Product page is a crucial component of the system, allowing consumers to verify the
authenticity of a product before or after purchase. The interface is user-friendly and designed
to accommodate both scanning and manual input options.
