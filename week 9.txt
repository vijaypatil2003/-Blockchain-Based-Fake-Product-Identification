# CONCLUSIONS


The project titled “Blockchain-based Fake Product Identification System” addresses the escalating issue of counterfeit goods in global supply chains by leveraging the fundamental attributes
of blockchain technology—decentralization, immutability, and transparency. Counterfeit products not only result in economic losses but also jeopardize consumer trust and safety.
The proposed system allows manufacturers to securely register product details on a blockchain
ledger, generating tamper-proof records linked to unique QR codes. Consumers can verify product authenticity by scanning the QR code, ensuring trust in the supply chain without relying
on centralized intermediaries. The system’s design emphasizes ease of use and accessibility,
promoting wider adoption across stakeholders.
By applying blockchain in this context, the solution demonstrates measurable potential to
improve traceability and integrity in product verification processes. The system can be generalized for various industries vulnerable to counterfeiting, including pharmaceuticals, electronics,
and luxury goods.
This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on decentralized trust mechanisms and highlights blockchain’s applicability in real-world anti-counterfeiting use cases. Future work may explore performance benchmarking, integration with IoT sensors, and support
for multi-stakeholder ecosystems at a global scale.
