# METHODOLOGY

1 Problem Formulation
The primary goal of this project is to develop a secure and transparent system that helps consumers and manufacturers identify counterfeit products in the market using blockchain technology. The problem formulation involves creating a system where product details are securely
recorded and stored in a decentralized blockchain ledger, ensuring that their authenticity can
be verified easily by consumers.
The core challenge is designing a blockchain-based system that provides both security and
user-friendliness. Blockchain provides security, but integrating it with existing systems and
ensuring a smooth user experience can be complex.


2 Data Collection
The data collection process includes gathering product-related information and ensuring its
integration with the blockchain. The following data points are collected:
• Product Information: This includes manufacture ID, product serial number, product
name, brand, and price.
• QR Code Generation: Once the product data is entered, a QR code is generated containing a link to the blockchain.
• Blockchain Transaction Data: Each product entry is recorded as a blockchain transaction,
ensuring an immutable record of its authenticity.
• User Interaction Data: Data from consumers interacting with the system to verify the
product will be logged for transparency


3 Model Architecture
The system architecture includes the following components:
• Frontend: A web-based interface for consumers to scan QR codes and verify product
authenticity • Blockchain Layer: Ethereum smart contracts store product details in an immutable
ledger.
• Backend: Manages requests from the frontend and interacts with the blockchain to retrieve and verify product information.
• QR Code Generation: A unique QR code is generated for each product, containing a
link to the blockchain for verification.

4 Evaluation
The system will be evaluated based on:
• Functionality: Correct product details should be retrieved on scanning the QR code.
• Security: The blockchain should prevent tampering, and unauthorized changes should be
impossible.
• Usability: The system should be easy for consumers to use and navigate.
• Performance: The system should be fast and responsive during verification.
• Scalability: The system should be able to handle increasing numbers of products and
users


6 Integration
The system is integrated as follows:
• Frontend and Blockchain Integration: The web interface communicates with the Ethereum
blockchain via REST APIs to retrieve product information.
• Backend and Blockchain Integration: The backend interacts with the Ethereum blockchain
through Web3.js to fetch product details.
• QR Code and Blockchain Integration: The QR code generated links to the blockchain
to verify product authenticity.
