# INTRODUCTION

The ever-increasing consumer preference for branded and premium products has, unfortunately,
given rise to a parallel and troubling surge in unethical practices such as product counterfeiting
and duplication. These unlawful activities have grown into a critical challenge for businesses
across sectors, causing extensive damage that goes far beyond simple financial implications.
Counterfeit products erode the goodwill and credibility that companies have spent years —
sometimes decades — building with their customers. The presence of fake goods in the market
significantly diminishes consumer trust, making customers question the authenticity of the
brand, often resulting in lost loyalty and long-term revenue decline.

Moreover, the circulation of duplicate products has severe economic consequences for legitimate companies. When inferior-quality imitations enter the market disguised as authentic
items, not only do they cannibalize market share, but they also mislead and endanger consumers. Buyers, unaware of the counterfeit nature of these items, often suffer due to the
substandard quality of materials or performance. This not only puts their health and safety at
risk but also tarnishes the reputation of the original brand.

Recognizing the severity of this ongoing issue, our project seeks to present a fundamental
yet effective solution through the application of blockchain technology. The core objective
of this system is to assist in the detection and tracking of genuine products throughout the
various stages of the supply chain. This is achieved by integrating a secure and immutable
blockchain layer that supports verification and transparency from the point of manufacture to
the final purchase by the customer. By allowing both manufacturers and end-users to confirm
the legitimacy of a product at each stage of its journey, the system aims to curb the impact of
counterfeit infiltration in the market.
