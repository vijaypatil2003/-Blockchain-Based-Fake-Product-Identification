# PROPOSED SYSTEM

Working of System
The proposed system aims to leverage blockchain technology for the authentication of products, ensuring that consumers can easily verify the originality of a product through a secure
and transparent process. The system involves two primary users: the Manufacturer and the
Consumer, each performing distinct actions to ensure product authenticity. Below is a detailed
explanation of how the system works:
1. Product Addition by Manufacturer
The manufacturer’s role in the system is pivotal to ensure the data is securely recorded and
verified on the blockchain. The manufacturer adds detailed information about the product into
the system, which is then processed and recorded on the blockchain.
• Step 1: Add Product Details
The manufacturer provides essential details about the product that will help in its identification and verification. These details include:
– Manufacturer ID: A unique identifier assigned to each manufacturer for distinguishing their products from others in the market.
– Product Serial Number (SN): A unique serial number assigned to each individual
product to differentiate it from other products of the same type.
– Product Price: The price at which the product is being sold in the market.
– Product Name: The name of the product, which typically includes the product’s
title or model.
– Product Brand: The brand under which the product is manufactured, which helps
in identifying the source and quality of the product.
These details are entered into the system by the manufacturer.
• Step 2: Generate QR Code
After the manufacturer enters the product details, a unique QR code is generated. This
QR code is tied to the blockchain record associated with that particular product. The QR code contains a reference that links to the product’s blockchain entry. This QR code
is then printed on the product packaging or attached to the product itself.
• Step 3: Record on Blockchain
Once the product details are entered and the QR code is generated, the system records
the product’s information on the blockchain. Blockchain ensures the data’s immutability, meaning that once entered, the data cannot be altered or tampered with. The use
of smart contracts allows the system to automatically manage and validate each product’s information as it gets added to the blockchain, ensuring complete transparency and
security.
By using blockchain, manufacturers can guarantee that the product details stored are reliable and cannot be forged or altered, providing a transparent and tamper-proof record of the
product’s authenticity.


2. Verification by Consumer
The consumer’s role is to verify the authenticity of the product before making a purchase or
after receiving the product. The process involves scanning the QR code on the product and
checking its details against the information stored on the blockchain.
• Step 1: Scan QR Code
The consumer uses a mobile app or any other compatible verification platform to scan the
QR code on the product. The QR code acts as a key to access the product’s information
stored securely on the blockchain.
• Step 2: System Query
Once the QR code is scanned, the consumer’s device sends a request to the system. The
system queries the blockchain to check the product’s information based on the product
serial number (SN) and other details. The query checks whether the product exists in
the blockchain database and whether the data matches the original record entered by the
manufacturer.
• Step 3: Result Displayed
After verifying the product’s data on the blockchain, the system displays the result to
the consumer. The result will indicate one of the following:
– Product is Real: If the serial number and other details match the information stored
on the blockchain, the system confirms that the product is genuine. The consumer is
assured that the product is authentic and has passed through the legitimate supply
chain.
– Product is Fake: If the system finds discrepancies or if the product’s serial number
does not match any record on the blockchain, the product is flagged as counterfeit.
The consumer is alerted, and further actions can be taken to report the counterfeit
product.
The result can be shown on the consumer’s mobile device or any other platform they are
using to scan the product’s QR code
